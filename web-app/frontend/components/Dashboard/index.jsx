    <p>
In this digital age, the security of legal records is of utmost importance. A breach in security can lead to significant losses, both financial and personal. The eVault is a highly secure cloud-based storage system that provides a solution to this problem.
    </p>
    <p>
The eVault is built using blockchain technology, which ensures that the data is stored in a decentralized manner and is not susceptible to hacking attempts. The use of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) ensures that the data is encrypted to a high degree, making it almost impossible for cybercriminals to penetrate. AES breaks down the data to be encrypted into 128 bits, making it highly secure against cyberattacks.
